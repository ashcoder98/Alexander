                    I am a very detail oriented person with a strong technical background thriving in an environment of
                    fast-learners, excellent collaborators, and creative solution seekers. I am passionate about coding,
                    especially building beautiful interfaces on the
                    front-end but I have the knowledge and experience to work on the backend of projects as well.

            <div class="long hide" id="longp">
                <p>I am a <span> passionate learner</span> who loves to <span>problem solve</span>,
                    and be great at anything I tackle.
                    Prior to General Assembly, I worked at Apple where there was
                    constant <span>collaboration</span> between employees of all levels. The most important fundamental
                    skill
                    I learned there was the ability to adapt and learn something new. Apple is a powerhouse of ingenuity
                    and this has forever impacted how adaptable I am to new information. I feel this has lead me to the
                    world of
                    coding. The constant cycle of learning has kindled my passion for coding.

                    <span>What makes coding
                        so amazing for me is the ability to impact others</span> and give people ways to display who
                    they are and what they want to show the world.
                    I want to be a person that builds someone up and puts a spotlight on them, but never myself. To
                    uplift other people's vision is my dream
                    in the coding world!
