                I am a very detail oriented person with a strong technical background thriving in an environment of fast-learners, excellent collaborators, and creative solution seekers. I am passionate about coding, especially building beautiful interfaces on the 
                front-end but I have the knowledge to work on the backend of projects as well.</div>

            <div class="long hide" id="longp">      <p>I am a <span> passionate learner</span> who loves to <span>problem solve</span>,
                and be great at anything I tackle.
                Prior to General Assembly, I worked at Apple where there was 
                constant <span>collaboration</span> between employees of all levels. The most important fundamental skill 
                I learned there was the ability to adapt and learn something new. Apple is a powerhouse of ingenuity
                and this has forever impacted how adaptable I am to new information. I feel this has lead me to the world of
                coding. The constant cycle of learning has kindled my passion for coding.
                <br />
                <span>What makes coding
                    so amazing for me is the ability to impact others</span> and give people ways to display who they are and what they want to show the world.
                    I want to be a person that builds someone up and puts a spotlight on them, but never myself. To uplift other people's vision is my dream
                    in the coding world!
